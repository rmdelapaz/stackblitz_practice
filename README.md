# Coding in Canvas

Welcome to an App Academy coding project!

To run your code in a problem file, run the following command in your terminal
and replace <problem-file-name> with the name of the problem file:

node problems/<problem-file-name>.js


For example, to run the first problem file in the /problems folder, run the
following command in your terminal:

node problems/01-coding-in-canvas.js


To run tests on your code, run the following command in your terminal:

npm test test/01-my-first-practice-test.js


To run all tests, use this command:

npm test


You know you are done with this coding project when all tests pass with green
check marks in your terminal!

Have fun coding! ðŸ˜Š
